# [SmoothLife in the browser](https://ajhamwood.github.io/smooth)

An implementation of Stephan Rafler's truly awesome continuous-domain generalisation of the Game of Life. Borrows heavily from this blog post by [Mikola Lysenko](https://0fps.net/2012/11/19/conways-game-of-life-for-curved-surfaces-part-1/).

In chrome you have the option to record webm video! (Still waiting for Mozilla to support canvas webp export...)

### Benchmarks for geeks

See the comparison between my native JS and WASM implementations of the Fast Fourier Transform [here](https://ajhamwood.github.io/smooth/fft-benchmark.html)!
